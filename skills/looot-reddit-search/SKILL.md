# Search Reddit

Reddit search API for an agent: it sends a search query to a catalog endpoint and reads post title, text and subreddit back. Several providers sell the call, so the agent tries the cheapest first. You pay per call, and a failed call costs nothing.

This skill needs the looot skill set up first: https://looot.ai/skill.md

## Ask for these inputs

The job takes a search query. Example: best crm for startups.

- The search query
- A subreddit, when the user names one

## Run it

1. Find the endpoint: `looot discover --mode auto --query "reddit search"`. The endpoints listed below are the known matches.
2. Read the price and the input schema before spending: `looot inspect <endpoint-id>`. Tell the user the price, then run.
3. Run it: `looot run scrapecreators-reddit-search --input '{"query":"best crm for startups","timeframe":"month"}' --idempotency-key <new-key> --wait`. Reuse the same key only to retry the same request.
4. Read the run's `status` and `error`, not the HTTP status. A run can return `failed` with a normal response.
5. If a run fails with a provider error or times out, try the next endpoint from the list below, cheapest first. If it fails on your input (a 4xx style error), fix the input. Do not retry it on other providers.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint reads the same job from a different provider. They differ in inputs, fields and price. Run `looot inspect` on the ones that take the input you hold, start with the cheapest, and move to the next on a provider error.

- `scrapecreators-reddit-search`: searches posts or comments across all of Reddit, with sort and time-frame options, and returns title, author, text, subreddit, score, upvote ratio, comment count and link
- `tikhub-api-reddit-app-fetch-dynamic-search`: runs the Reddit app's dynamic search over posts, communities, comments, media and users, with sort, time range and paging

## What comes back

- Post title and text
- Subreddit
- Score and upvote ratio
- Comment count
- Link

## Answer rule

List title, subreddit, score and link, then the common points across threads. Quote at most a line from a post.

## Before you start

- Choose posts or comments. Posts give the thread, and comments give the opinions inside it.
- Set a time window. A thread from three years ago ranks well but may describe a product that no longer exists.
- Read before you reply. Reddit is strict about promotion, and your agent should only collect the research.

## Cost rules

- Searching and inspecting are free. Running is billed per call at the price `looot inspect` shows.
- Say the price before the first run, and the total after a batch.
- Never loop a failing call. Stop after two failures and report what failed.

## When not to use this skill

Use `looot-tiktok-search` instead when you want short video posts on a topic, not forum threads.
