# Look up an Amazon product

Amazon product details API for an agent: it sends an ASIN or a product URL to a catalog endpoint and reads title, brand and price back. Several providers sell the call, so the agent tries the cheapest first. You pay per call, and a failed call costs nothing.

This skill needs the looot skill set up first: https://looot.ai/skill.md

## Ask for these inputs

The job takes an ASIN or a product URL. Example: B09B8V1LZ3.

- An ASIN or a product URL
- The Amazon marketplace, such as amazon.com or amazon.de

## Run it

1. Find the endpoint: `looot discover --mode auto --query "amazon product details"`. The endpoints listed below are the known matches.
2. Read the price and the input schema before spending: `looot inspect <endpoint-id>`. Tell the user the price, then run.
3. Run it: `looot run searchapi-io-amazon-product --input '{"asin":"B09B8V1LZ3","amazon_domain":"amazon.com"}' --idempotency-key <new-key> --wait`. Reuse the same key only to retry the same request.
4. Read the run's `status` and `error`, not the HTTP status. A run can return `failed` with a normal response.
5. If a run fails with a provider error or times out, try the next endpoint from the list below, cheapest first. If it fails on your input (a 4xx style error), fix the input. Do not retry it on other providers.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint reads the same job from a different provider. They differ in inputs, fields and price. Run `looot inspect` on the ones that take the input you hold, start with the cheapest, and move to the next on a provider error.

- `searchapi-io-amazon-product`: takes an ASIN with a marketplace domain, delivery country and postal code, and returns title, pricing, reviews and specifications
- `anysite-api-amazon-products`: takes an ASIN or a product URL and returns title, brand, price, images, rating, features, specifications, variations, seller and availability
- `brightdata-amazon-product`: takes a product URL and returns title, brand, price, rating, review count, best-seller rank, features, images, variants and seller

## What comes back

- Title and brand
- Price and availability
- Rating and review count
- Features and specifications
- Images and variants
- Seller

## Answer rule

Give title, price, availability, rating and review count first, then features. Say which marketplace the price is from.

## Before you start

- Set the marketplace and the delivery country. Price and stock on Amazon depend on where the item ships, and a default may not match your market.
- Keep the ASIN, not the URL, as your key. URLs carry tracking text, and the ASIN is the stable id.
- For reviews, use the reviews endpoint. The product call gives the rating and the count, and a separate endpoint returns the review text.

## Cost rules

- Searching and inspecting are free. Running is billed per call at the price `looot inspect` shows.
- Say the price before the first run, and the total after a batch.
- Never loop a failing call. Stop after two failures and report what failed.

## When not to use this skill

Use `looot-reddit-search` instead when you want what people say about a product category, not one listing.
