# Find a professional email

Professional email finder API for an agent: it sends a full name and a company domain to a catalog endpoint and reads work email, verification status and confidence score back. Several providers sell the call, so the agent tries the cheapest first. You pay per call, and a failed call costs nothing.

This skill needs the looot skill set up first: https://looot.ai/skill.md

## Ask for these inputs

The job takes a full name and a company domain. Example: Jane Doe at example.com.

- Full name of the person
- Company domain, such as example.com. Ask if you only have the company name

## Run it

1. Find the endpoint: `looot discover --mode auto --query "professional email finder"`. The endpoints listed below are the known matches.
2. Read the price and the input schema before spending: `looot inspect <endpoint-id>`. Tell the user the price, then run.
3. Run it: `looot run tomba-email-finder --input '{"domain":"example.com","full_name":"Jane Doe"}' --idempotency-key <new-key> --wait`. Reuse the same key only to retry the same request.
4. Read the run's `status` and `error`, not the HTTP status. A run can return `failed` with a normal response.
5. If a run fails with a provider error or times out, try the next endpoint from the list below, cheapest first. If it fails on your input (a 4xx style error), fix the input. Do not retry it on other providers.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint reads the same job from a different provider. They differ in inputs, fields and price. Run `looot inspect` on the ones that take the input you hold, start with the cheapest, and move to the next on a provider error.

- `tomba-email-finder`: takes a domain or company plus a full name, and returns a score, a verification status, the position and the sources where the address was seen
- `icypeas-email-find`: takes domainOrCompany plus a first and last name, waits up to 60 seconds and returns each email with a certainty
- `leadmagic-people-email-finder`: returns the email with a status and company details such as industry and size
- `hunter-email-finder`: also accepts a LinkedIn handle alone, and returns the score, position, phone number and sources
- `anysite-api-linkedin-user-find-email-by-url`: starts from a LinkedIn profile URL with the vanity alias and returns the email, its validity and the job title

## What comes back

- Work email
- Verification status
- Confidence score
- Job title
- LinkedIn profile

## Answer rule

Give the email, its verification status and the confidence score on one line. Never present an unverified address as confirmed.

## Before you start

- Give the company's domain when you have it. A domain finds the right person more often than a company name, which can match several firms.
- Verify what you find. A found address that was never checked is a guess with a good reason behind it.
- A search that finds nothing is not billed by most providers here, so a miss costs you nothing. Check the endpoint page for the one you use.

## Cost rules

- Searching and inspecting are free. Running is billed per call at the price `looot inspect` shows.
- Say the price before the first run, and the total after a batch.
- Never loop a failing call. Stop after two failures and report what failed.

## When not to use this skill

Use `looot-enrich-a-person` instead when you already hold a LinkedIn URL or an email and want the whole profile, not just an address.
