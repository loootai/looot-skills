# Enrich a person

Person enrichment API for an agent: it sends an email, a LinkedIn profile, or a name and a company to a catalog endpoint and reads full name, title and employer back. Several providers sell the call, so the agent tries the cheapest first. You pay per call, and a failed call costs nothing.

This skill needs the looot skill set up first: https://looot.ai/skill.md

## Ask for these inputs

The job takes an email, a LinkedIn profile, or a name and a company. Example: jane.doe@example.com.

- An email, a LinkedIn profile, or a name with a company

## Run it

1. Find the endpoint: `looot discover --mode auto --query "person enrichment"`. The endpoints listed below are the known matches.
2. Read the price and the input schema before spending: `looot inspect <endpoint-id>`. Tell the user the price, then run.
3. Run it: `looot run hunter-people-find --input '{"email":"jane.doe@example.com"}' --idempotency-key <new-key> --wait`. Reuse the same key only to retry the same request.
4. Read the run's `status` and `error`, not the HTTP status. A run can return `failed` with a normal response.
5. If a run fails with a provider error or times out, try the next endpoint from the list below, cheapest first. If it fails on your input (a 4xx style error), fix the input. Do not retry it on other providers.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint reads the same job from a different provider. They differ in inputs, fields and price. Run `looot inspect` on the ones that take the input you hold, start with the cheapest, and move to the next on a provider error.

- `hunter-people-find`: takes an email or a LinkedIn handle and returns name, employer, role, seniority, location, bio and social handles
- `tomba-people-find`: takes an email and returns the name, location and social handles such as Twitter
- `fullenrich-api-people-lookup`: matches one person by profile URL or id, or by name with a company domain, and charges only when a person is found
- `prospeo-enrich-person`: takes a name with a company, an email or a LinkedIn URL, and can add a verified mobile number; free when nothing matches
- `aviato-person-enrich`: takes one identifier and returns the name, profile URLs and whether a work or personal email exists
- `people-data-labs-person-enrich`: returns the deepest record, with experience, education and locations, and lets you set how sure the match must be

## What comes back

- Full name and title
- Employer and seniority
- Location
- Social profiles
- Education and experience

## Answer rule

List the fields found, name the ones that came back empty, and do not fill gaps from memory.

## Before you start

- Send the most specific identifier you hold. An email or a profile URL matches more reliably than a name alone.
- Decide the minimum fields you need. A cheap lookup answers who someone is and where they work, which covers most routing and scoring.
- Keep the match likelihood. Where a provider reports one, store it with the record so a weak match does not pass as a sure one.

## Cost rules

- Searching and inspecting are free. Running is billed per call at the price `looot inspect` shows.
- Say the price before the first run, and the total after a batch.
- Never loop a failing call. Stop after two failures and report what failed.

## When not to use this skill

Use `looot-find-professional-emails` instead when all you need is a work email for a name and a domain.
