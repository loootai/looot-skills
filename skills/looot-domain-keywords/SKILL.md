# Find the keywords a domain ranks for

Domain keywords API for an agent: it sends a domain or a page URL to a catalog endpoint and reads organic keywords, paid keywords and ranking position back. Several providers sell the call, so the agent tries the cheapest first. You pay per call, and a failed call costs nothing.

This skill needs the looot skill set up first: https://looot.ai/skill.md

## Ask for these inputs

The job takes a domain or a page URL. Example: example.com.

- A domain or a page URL
- The country, when the user cares about one market

## Run it

1. Find the endpoint: `looot discover --mode auto --query "domain keywords"`. The endpoints listed below are the known matches.
2. Read the price and the input schema before spending: `looot inspect <endpoint-id>`. Tell the user the price, then run.
3. Run it: `looot run adyntel-domain-keywords --input '{"company_domain":"example.com","limit":50}' --idempotency-key <new-key> --wait`. Reuse the same key only to retry the same request.
4. Read the run's `status` and `error`, not the HTTP status. A run can return `failed` with a normal response.
5. If a run fails with a provider error or times out, try the next endpoint from the list below, cheapest first. If it fails on your input (a 4xx style error), fix the input. Do not retry it on other providers.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint reads the same job from a different provider. They differ in inputs, fields and price. Run `looot inspect` on the ones that take the input you hold, start with the cheapest, and move to the next on a provider error.

- `adyntel-domain-keywords`: lists the keywords a domain ranks for organically and the ones it pays for on Google, with a limit and a language
- `dataforseo-dataforseo-labs-google-ranked-keywords-live-ai`: lists what a domain or a page ranks for, with the result types, impressions and monthly searches, plus filters and ordering
- `dataforseo-dataforseo-labs-google-keywords-for-site-live`: returns keywords relevant to a site with categories, last-month volume, cost per click, competition and a 12-month trend

## What comes back

- Organic keywords
- Paid keywords
- Ranking position
- Monthly searches
- Cost per click

## Answer rule

Show keyword, position, monthly searches and CPC for the top rows, and say how many keywords exist in total.

## Before you start

- Choose the location and language. Rankings are local, and a domain can rank first in one country and not at all in the next.
- Set a limit. A large site ranks for hundreds of thousands of keywords, and results are billed per call, so ask for the top slice first.
- Look at one page at a time when you can. One endpoint accepts a page URL, and the keyword set of a single article is easier to act on than that of a whole site.

## Cost rules

- Searching and inspecting are free. Running is billed per call at the price `looot inspect` shows.
- Say the price before the first run, and the total after a batch.
- Never loop a failing call. Stop after two failures and report what failed.

## When not to use this skill

Use `looot-keyword-volume` instead when you have the keywords and want their volume and cost per click.
