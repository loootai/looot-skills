# Find a company's email format

Company email format API for an agent: it sends a company domain to a catalog endpoint and reads email pattern such as first.last, share of addresses that use it and other patterns in use back. Several providers sell the call, so the agent tries the cheapest first. You pay per call, and a failed call costs nothing.

This skill needs the looot skill set up first: https://looot.ai/skill.md

## Ask for these inputs

The job takes a company domain. Example: example.com.

- A company domain

## Run it

1. Find the endpoint: `looot discover --mode auto --query "company email format"`. The endpoints listed below are the known matches.
2. Read the price and the input schema before spending: `looot inspect <endpoint-id>`. Tell the user the price, then run.
3. Run it: `looot run tomba-email-format --input '{"domain":"example.com"}' --idempotency-key <new-key> --wait`. Reuse the same key only to retry the same request.
4. Read the run's `status` and `error`, not the HTTP status. A run can return `failed` with a normal response.
5. If a run fails with a provider error or times out, try the next endpoint from the list below, cheapest first. If it fails on your input (a 4xx style error), fix the input. Do not retry it on other providers.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint reads the same job from a different provider. They differ in inputs, fields and price. Run `looot inspect` on the ones that take the input you hold, start with the cheapest, and move to the next on a provider error.

- `tomba-email-format`: returns the patterns a domain uses, such as first.last@, and is free
- `thecompaniesapi-companies-email-patterns`: takes a domain and lets you set an email count and a precision level to refine the answer

## What comes back

- Email pattern such as first.last
- Share of addresses that use it
- Other patterns in use

## Answer rule

Give the pattern with an example, the share of addresses that follow it, and any second pattern in use. Say a pattern is a guess until an address is verified.

## Before you start

- A pattern is a guess about one person. Build the address from it, then verify it before you send anything.
- Large companies often run several patterns, one per brand or per acquired firm. Ask for every pattern and test the likeliest first.
- Small domains have little data. A short list or an empty answer means the provider has seen few addresses there.
- Store the pattern with the domain. One lookup serves every person at that company, so your agent should keep it and reuse it instead of paying again.

## Cost rules

- Searching and inspecting are free. Running is billed per call at the price `looot inspect` shows.
- Say the price before the first run, and the total after a batch.
- Never loop a failing call. Stop after two failures and report what failed.

## When not to use this skill

Use `looot-find-professional-emails` instead when you want a confirmed address for one person, not the pattern.
