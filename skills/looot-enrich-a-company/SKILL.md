# Enrich a company

Company enrichment API for an agent: it sends a company domain to a catalog endpoint and reads company name, description and industry back. Several providers sell the call, so the agent tries the cheapest first. You pay per call, and a failed call costs nothing.

This skill needs the looot skill set up first: https://looot.ai/skill.md

## Ask for these inputs

The job takes a company domain. Example: example.com.

- A company domain, or a list of domains

## Run it

1. Find the endpoint: `looot discover --mode auto --query "company enrichment"`. The endpoints listed below are the known matches.
2. Read the price and the input schema before spending: `looot inspect <endpoint-id>`. Tell the user the price, then run.
3. Run it: `looot run hunter-companies-find --input '{"domain":"example.com"}' --idempotency-key <new-key> --wait`. Reuse the same key only to retry the same request.
4. Read the run's `status` and `error`, not the HTTP status. A run can return `failed` with a normal response.
5. If a run fails with a provider error or times out, try the next endpoint from the list below, cheapest first. If it fails on your input (a 4xx style error), fix the input. Do not retry it on other providers.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint reads the same job from a different provider. They differ in inputs, fields and price. Run `looot inspect` on the ones that take the input you hold, start with the cheapest, and move to the next on a provider error.

- `hunter-companies-find`: returns the industry category, company type, founded year, email provider, funding rounds and social profiles
- `tomba-companies-find`: adds legal name, industry codes (sector, SIC, NAICS) and the phone numbers and email addresses on the company's site
- `fullenrich-api-company-lookup`: matches by domain, LinkedIn URL or id and charges only when a company is found
- `leadmagic-companies-company-search`: takes a domain, a name or a LinkedIn URL and adds competitors and growth figures
- `prospeo-enrich-company`: returns keywords and technologies with the profile, and is free when nothing matches
- `aviato-company-enrich`: takes one identifier, including a Crunchbase or Twitter id, and returns industries, headcount and links
- `akta-company-enrichment`: returns only the sections you request: firmographics, funding, headcount, web traffic, business model or financials
- `people-data-labs-company-enrich`: takes a website, name, LinkedIn URL or ticker and returns size, employee count, industry, founding year and tags

## What comes back

- Company name and description
- Industry
- Headcount and range
- Headquarters
- Founded year
- Funding and tech stack when the provider has them

## Answer rule

Show headcount, industry, headquarters and founding year first. Mark funding and tech stack as missing when the provider has none.

## Before you start

- Send the bare domain without a path. One provider wants the full website with its protocol, and your agent reads that on the endpoint page.
- Name the sections you need. One provider returns only the sections you ask for, so asking for fewer costs less.
- Cache results on your side. Only one provider here skips the charge for a company you enriched in the last 90 days, and your own copy is cheaper than any lookup.

## Cost rules

- Searching and inspecting are free. Running is billed per call at the price `looot inspect` shows.
- Say the price before the first run, and the total after a batch.
- Never loop a failing call. Stop after two failures and report what failed.

## When not to use this skill

Use `looot-company-list-builder` instead when you have no company yet and want to find companies by industry, size or technology.
