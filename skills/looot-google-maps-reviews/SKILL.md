# Read Google Maps reviews

Google Maps reviews API for an agent: it sends a Google Maps place ID to a catalog endpoint and reads review text, star rating and reviewer name back. Several providers sell the call, so the agent tries the cheapest first. You pay per call, and a failed call costs nothing.

This skill needs the looot skill set up first: https://looot.ai/skill.md

## Ask for these inputs

The job takes a Google Maps place ID. Example: ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4.

- The Google Maps place ID. Ask for the business name and location to look it up when the user has no ID
- How many reviews

## Run it

1. Find the endpoint: `looot discover --mode auto --query "google maps reviews"`. The endpoints listed below are the known matches.
2. Read the price and the input schema before spending: `looot inspect <endpoint-id>`. Tell the user the price, then run.
3. Run it: `looot run anyapi-run-maps-reviews --input '{"placeId":"ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4","limit":100}' --idempotency-key <new-key> --wait`. Reuse the same key only to retry the same request.
4. Read the run's `status` and `error`, not the HTTP status. A run can return `failed` with a normal response.
5. If a run fails with a provider error or times out, try the next endpoint from the list below, cheapest first. If it fails on your input (a 4xx style error), fix the input. Do not retry it on other providers.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint reads the same job from a different provider. They differ in inputs, fields and price. Run `looot inspect` on the ones that take the input you hold, start with the cheapest, and move to the next on a provider error.

- `anyapi-run-maps-reviews`: fetches up to 100 reviews for a place ID in one request, with language, sort and a flat price per request
- `anysite-api-google-maps-reviews`: takes a feature ID, a numeric CID or a place ID, with sort and a count, and bills per result
- `searchapi-io-google-maps-reviews`: takes a place ID or a data ID, pages with a token, sorts and can filter by topic

## What comes back

- Review text
- Star rating
- Reviewer name
- Posted date
- Owner reply

## Answer rule

Summarize the themes with the star rating, quote at most a line from a review, and say how many reviews were read.

## Before you start

- Get the place ID first. A Google Maps search returns it for each business, and the different providers accept different forms of the ID.
- Sort the way you need. Newest first answers what customers say now, and most helpful first answers what they say most.
- Mind the volume. A busy place has thousands of reviews, and a provider billed per result charges for each one, so set a count.

## Cost rules

- Searching and inspecting are free. Running is billed per call at the price `looot inspect` shows.
- Say the price before the first run, and the total after a batch.
- Never loop a failing call. Stop after two failures and report what failed.

## When not to use this skill

Use `looot-local-business-search` instead when you have no place yet and need to find businesses first.
