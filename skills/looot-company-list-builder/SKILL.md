# Build a company list

Company list builder API for an agent: it sends filters such as industry, size, country or technology to a catalog endpoint and reads company name, domain and industry back. Several providers sell the call, so the agent tries the cheapest first. You pay per call, and a failed call costs nothing.

This skill needs the looot skill set up first: https://looot.ai/skill.md

## Ask for these inputs

The job takes filters such as industry, size, country or technology. Example: software companies in the US with 50 to 200 employees that use Stripe.

- Industry, size, country or technology filters, as many as the user has
- How many companies to return

## Run it

1. Find the endpoint: `looot discover --mode auto --query "company list builder"`. The endpoints listed below are the known matches.
2. Read the price and the input schema before spending: `looot inspect <endpoint-id>`. Tell the user the price, then run.
3. Run it: `looot run theirstack-companies-search --input '{"limit":10,"company_country_code_or":["US"]}' --idempotency-key <new-key> --wait`. Reuse the same key only to retry the same request.
4. Read the run's `status` and `error`, not the HTTP status. A run can return `failed` with a normal response.
5. If a run fails with a provider error or times out, try the next endpoint from the list below, cheapest first. If it fails on your input (a 4xx style error), fix the input. Do not retry it on other providers.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint reads the same job from a different provider. They differ in inputs, fields and price. Run `looot inspect` on the ones that take the input you hold, start with the cheapest, and move to the next on a provider error.

- `theirstack-companies-search`: filters by industry, country, employee count, revenue, funding, technology stack and hiring signals, with 1 to 25 results per page
- `fullenrich-api-company-search`: filters by name, domain, industry, headquarters, headcount, keywords or founding year, and bills per company returned
- `thecompaniesapi-companies-post`: runs a segmentation search with a query, a page and a size, and bills per company returned
- `people-data-labs-company-search-get`: takes a SQL WHERE clause or an Elasticsearch query as JSON and returns full company records
- `aviato-company-search`: takes a query in the Aviato query language with a filters array and returns a count plus the matching companies

## What comes back

- Company name and domain
- Industry and country
- Employee count
- Matching technologies and jobs
- LinkedIn page

## Answer rule

Return a table of name, domain, country and employee count, and say how many matched in total.

## Before you start

- Start narrow. Each company returned is billed, so a query that returns thousands costs real money. Set a limit and widen it once the sample looks right.
- Check the filter names on the endpoint page. They differ per provider, and a misspelled filter returns everything or nothing.
- Plan the next step before you search. A list of domains feeds company enrichment, email-format lookups and people search.

## Cost rules

- Searching and inspecting are free. Running is billed per call at the price `looot inspect` shows.
- Say the price before the first run, and the total after a batch.
- Never loop a failing call. Stop after two failures and report what failed.

## When not to use this skill

Use `looot-enrich-a-company` instead when you already have the domains and want details on each.
