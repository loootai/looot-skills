# Search TikTok

TikTok search API for an agent: it sends a keyword to a catalog endpoint and reads video caption, views and likes back. Several providers sell the call, so the agent tries the cheapest first. You pay per call, and a failed call costs nothing.

This skill needs the looot skill set up first: https://looot.ai/skill.md

## Ask for these inputs

The job takes a keyword. Example: home workout.

- A keyword
- How many videos

## Run it

1. Find the endpoint: `looot discover --mode auto --query "tiktok search"`. The endpoints listed below are the known matches.
2. Read the price and the input schema before spending: `looot inspect <endpoint-id>`. Tell the user the price, then run.
3. Run it: `looot run anyapi-run-tiktok-search-keyword --input '{"query":"home workout"}' --idempotency-key <new-key> --wait`. Reuse the same key only to retry the same request.
4. Read the run's `status` and `error`, not the HTTP status. A run can return `failed` with a normal response.
5. If a run fails with a provider error or times out, try the next endpoint from the list below, cheapest first. If it fails on your input (a 4xx style error), fix the input. Do not retry it on other providers.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint reads the same job from a different provider. They differ in inputs, fields and price. Run `looot inspect` on the ones that take the input you hold, start with the cheapest, and move to the next on a provider error.

- `anyapi-run-tiktok-search-keyword`: returns videos with caption, views, likes, comments and shares as normalized JSON, with sort and posting-date filters and a flat price per request
- `anysite-api-tiktok-videos-search`: searches videos by keyword with a count, and bills per result
- `tikhub-api-tiktok-web-fetch-search-video`: takes a keyword, a count and an offset, and pages with a search ID
- `tikhub-api-tiktok-app-fetch-video-search-result`: takes a keyword with a region, a sort type and a publish-time filter

## What comes back

- Video caption
- Views
- Likes and comments
- Shares
- Author

## Answer rule

List caption, author, views, likes and link, sorted by views. Say the keyword and the date of the search.

## Before you start

- Set the sort. Most-liked and newest answer different questions, and the default may not be the one you need.
- Keep the search ID when you page. One provider needs it for the second page and later.
- Note the region. TikTok serves different results per market, and one endpoint takes a region parameter to set it.

## Cost rules

- Searching and inspecting are free. Running is billed per call at the price `looot inspect` shows.
- Say the price before the first run, and the total after a batch.
- Never loop a failing call. Stop after two failures and report what failed.

## When not to use this skill

Use `looot-reddit-search` instead when you want written discussion, not short videos.
