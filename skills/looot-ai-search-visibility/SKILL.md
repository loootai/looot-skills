# Check AI search visibility

AI search visibility API for an agent: it sends a prompt your buyers would ask and a country to a catalog endpoint and reads answer text, cited sources and brands mentioned back. Several providers sell the call, so the agent tries the cheapest first. You pay per call, and a failed call costs nothing.

This skill needs the looot skill set up first: https://looot.ai/skill.md

## Ask for these inputs

The job takes a prompt your buyers would ask and a country. Example: best project management tools for small teams.

- The prompt a buyer would ask
- The brand names to look for
- The country

## Run it

1. Find the endpoint: `looot discover --mode auto --query "ai search visibility"`. The endpoints listed below are the known matches.
2. Read the price and the input schema before spending: `looot inspect <endpoint-id>`. Tell the user the price, then run.
3. Run it: `looot run cloro-monitor-chatgpt --input '{"prompt":"best project management tools for small teams","country":"US"}' --idempotency-key <new-key> --wait`. Reuse the same key only to retry the same request.
4. Read the run's `status` and `error`, not the HTTP status. A run can return `failed` with a normal response.
5. If a run fails with a provider error or times out, try the next endpoint from the list below, cheapest first. If it fails on your input (a 4xx style error), fix the input. Do not retry it on other providers.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint reads the same job from a different provider. They differ in inputs, fields and price. Run `looot inspect` on the ones that take the input you hold, start with the cheapest, and move to the next on a provider error.

- `cloro-monitor-chatgpt`: runs a prompt through the live ChatGPT interface from a chosen country, with cited sources, brand entities and, on request, shopping cards and ads
- `cloro-monitor-perplexity`: runs a prompt through the live Perplexity interface and returns the answer, cited sources, shopping cards and place cards
- `cloro-monitor-gemini`: runs a prompt through the live Gemini interface and returns the answer with its cited sources, as text, Markdown or HTML
- `brightdata-chatgpt-answer`: asks ChatGPT through a scraper and returns the answer text and its citations, with a follow-up prompt option
- `searchapi-io-chatgpt`: queries logged-out ChatGPT and returns Markdown and typed text blocks plus the cited links when web search is on
- `searchapi-io-perplexity`: returns Perplexity's answer as text blocks, a Markdown version and the cited references
- `dataforseo-google-ai-mode-advanced`: returns Google AI Mode results in the advanced format
- `anyapi-run-google-ai-overview`: returns the AI Overview Google generates for a prompt, with every source it lists

## What comes back

- Answer text
- Cited sources
- Brands mentioned
- Shopping cards
- Search queries the engine ran

## Answer rule

Say which brands the answer named, in what order, and which sources it cited. One run is one sample, so say that answers vary.

## Before you start

- Write prompts the way buyers ask, not the way you would search. A long question gets a different answer from a short keyword.
- Run each prompt more than once. An engine can answer differently each time, and Google regenerates its AI Overview on every search.
- Check the country. Each engine refuses a few countries, and an answer from the US is not the answer a buyer in Germany sees.

## Cost rules

- Searching and inspecting are free. Running is billed per call at the price `looot inspect` shows.
- Say the price before the first run, and the total after a batch.
- Never loop a failing call. Stop after two failures and report what failed.

## When not to use this skill

Use `looot-google-serp` instead when you want the classic ranked results, not an AI answer.
